## It would be fun to have a rule that does mkdir when appropriate, but we don't

## merge notes
## I mostly merge on idnum. Strategy is to make it numeric as often 
## as seems necessary while merging. Then pad it right before avenue
## or mosaic. Current code in avenueMerge.R

## Spreadsheets with TA marks from HWs and SAs
## How did we make original spreadsheet from Avenue?

## Import TA marks (manual) and change empties to zeroes
## Use named versions of marks.tsv (no revision control in Dropbox)
## Need to update in Apr 2019
